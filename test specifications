Functional Tests
A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
Expectations:

Handling of an empty cart.
User flow for guest checkout.
User flow for logged-in checkout.
Prompting user to create an account or log in if checking out as a guest.
Proper handling of payment and shipping information.
Displaying confirmation and summary information.
Specifications:

When a user attempts to check out with an empty cart, they should be shown an error message stating that the cart is empty and be prompted to add items.
When a user chooses to check out as a guest, they should be asked to provide shipping information and payment details.
When a user chooses to check out as a guest, after providing the required information, they should be asked if they want to create an account or continue as a guest.
When a user chooses to check out as a logged-in user, they should be prompted to log in if they are not already logged in.
When a logged-in user attempts to check out, they should see their saved shipping information and be able to edit it.
When a logged-in user attempts to check out, they should see their saved payment methods and be able to choose or add a new one.
When a user provides invalid shipping information (e.g., incorrect address format), they should be shown an error message and prompted to correct it.
When a user provides invalid payment information (e.g., expired credit card), they should be shown an error message and prompted to correct it.
When a user completes the checkout process, they should see a confirmation page summarizing their order details, shipping address, and payment method.
When a user completes the checkout process, they should receive a confirmation email with the order details.
When a user checks out as a guest and opts to create an account, they should be prompted to set a password after entering their order details.
When a user checks out as a guest and opts to create an account, they should be automatically logged in after the checkout process is complete.
